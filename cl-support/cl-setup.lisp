;;; The mumble package exports only those symbols that have definitions
;;; in mumble.  Many of these symbols shadow built-in CL definitions.
;;; Programs that use mumble should use the mumble package in place of
;;; (rather than in addition to) the CL package.

;;; The actual implementation of the mumble compatibility library happens
;;; in the MUMBLE-IMPLEMENTATION package.  We'll explicitly package-qualify
;;; all symbols from the MUMBLE package that it references, and rely
;;; on the definitional macros to arrange to export them from the MUMBLE
;;; package.
