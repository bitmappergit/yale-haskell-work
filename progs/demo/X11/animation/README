In his paper "A Functional Animation Starter Kit" [ARYA88], Kevi Arya 
proposes an approach to animation that uses functional languages. As
Arya describes, the cost of computing power is falling. This is making
the use of computer animation much more prevalent. However, languages
such as C make it difficult to program animations. What is needed is
a simpler, faster and more accessible way to program graphics. Functional
languages are a very effective means for this, due to their higher order
functions.
 
	Kevi Arya goes on to provide such a functional animation package in
the language Miranda. Haskell in particular is good functional language for
two reasons. It is a completely functional language, doing even I/O in a 
functional manner. Variables are evaluated in a lazy manner allowing infinite 
lists to be manipulated easily, which suits the infinite frames format
of animation.

The following animations are provided here:

  seaside.hs  - a seaside scene
  planets.hs  - planets in orbit
  palm.hs     - another seaside scene
  birds.hs    - flying birds
