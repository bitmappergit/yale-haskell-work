Our Logo interpreter will only support one of the three windowing
modes: window mode, where the turtle, if it walks off the end of the
screen, just continues going and does not wrap.  The two (unsupported)
modes are fence mode where the turtle cannot walk off the end, and
wrap mode.  The initial turtle state will be with the turtle hidden,
the pen down, and the turtle in the center of the screen facing
upwards.

All input (both for commands as well as user-input) will be
case-insensitive, and the interpreter needs to handle lists, words,
integers, and boolean values.  Also, typing "GoodBye" at the LOGO>
prompt exits the interpreter.

All commands will be enclosed in parentheses, and all lists of
commands will be enclosed in square brackets, so that there is no
longer any need for the keyword "End". Also, all procedures will
return the value of their last command, so that there are no Stop or
Output commands.  IF statements should return the value of the last
statement executed, but all looping constructs should return no value.
