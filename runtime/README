This directory contains definitions of things that are used
exclusively in code generated by the Haskell compiler.  It contains
implementations of some of the things declared in the prims files for
the prelude, as well as some more generic things that the code
generator knows about.  

Note that some of the files in this directory access some Common Lisp
features directly.
