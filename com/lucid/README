This directory contains command scripts used for building Yale Haskell
from the source distribution under Lucid Common Lisp.  We have been using
Lucid version 4.0.0 on a Sparc, but we don't expect that there would
be difficulties in building with Lucid on other platforms.

Developers need to source haskell-development instead of haskell-setup
in the .cshrc file.

To rebuild the system:

* You need to define environment variables Y2 and LUCID to point to the
  appropriate pathnames.  See the haskell-development script for details.

* Make sure that the environment variable PRELUDEBIN (in the 
  haskell-setup script) points to $PRELUDE/lucid.

* Execute the "compile" script.  This will recompile all of the Lisp 
  source files that make up the Yale Haskell system.  Compiled files are
  put in the "lucid" subdirectory of each source directory.

* Execute the "build-prelude" script to compile the standard prelude.  
  Note that this process tends to use up a huge amount of memory!

* Execute the "savesys" script to build a new executable.

* The new executable is initially called "bin/new-lucid-haskell".  Try
  it out.  If it works, you should rename it to "bin/lucid-haskell".
  Make sure that HASKELLPROG (in the haskell-setup script) is correct.

* If you want to build an executable with the X support, you'll also
  need to run the "build-xlib" and "savesys-xlib" scripts.  You
  need to edit these scripts to change the pathname of the file 
  containing the CLX library (or suppress the load entirely if you
  are using a Lisp executable with CLX pre-loaded.).

Important note for Emacs users: We've been told that Lucid provides
some patches to GNU Emacs that cause the Haskell Emacs mode not to work.
(Apparently these patches redefine some of the interprocess communication
functions in an incompatible way.)  Use a standard Emacs.
