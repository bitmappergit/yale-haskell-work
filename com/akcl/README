This directory contains command scripts used for building Yale Haskell
from the source distribution under AKCL.  We have been using
AKCL version 1.615 on a Sparc, but we don't expect that there would
be difficulties in building with AKCL on other platforms.

Developers need to source haskell-development instead of haskell-setup
in the .cshrc file.

To rebuild the system:

* You need to define environment variables Y2 and AKCL to point to the
  appropriate pathnames.  See the haskell-development script for details.

* Make sure that the environment variable PRELUDEBIN (in the 
  haskell-setup script) points to $PRELUDE/akcl.

* Execute the "compile" script.  This will recompile all of the Lisp 
  source files that make up the Yale Haskell system.  Compiled files are
  put in the "akcl" subdirectory of each source directory.

* Execute the "build-prelude" script to compile the standard prelude.  
  Note that this process tends to use up a huge amount of memory!

* Execute the "savesys" script to build a new executable.

* The new executable is initially called "bin/new-akcl-haskell".  Try
  it out.  If it works, you should rename it to "bin/akcl-haskell".
  Make sure that HASKELLPROG (in the haskell-setup script) is correct.

A word of warning: we have noticed that AKCL is slower by a factor of
three or four than the other Common Lisps we've ported Yale Haskell
to.  We don't really support AKCL and we encourage you to buy one of
the commercial Lisp products instead.

We do not support our Haskell-to-CLX interface under AKCL, either.
